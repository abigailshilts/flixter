# Project 1 - *Flixter*

**Flixter** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [✅] User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- [✅] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [✅] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [✅] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [✅] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- [✅] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [✅] User can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to make UIAlerts more specified to certain actions
2. How the code for retrieving data from a database works

## Video Walkthrough

For a walkthrough see AppWalkThroughP1.mov

## Notes

I ran into a lot of issues related to the outlets and ensuring that items had proper classes. 
Continuing to work on it is helping for the way object oriented programing applies to xCode 
to become more clear.
